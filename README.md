Coding this portfolio site was a bigger challenge than I expected. Having coding only a business card site before, I knew I had to create separate pages for the site as well as pages for each of my projects. This project was also my introduction into using css grid. Utilizing the gird really helped me organize how I wanted my page to look on mobile view and it translated well with the desktop version. One of the major challenges I had was getting things to center on my page including nav bar, social media icons, and illustrations on each of the pages. Using padding and margin properties in css helped me center everything. 
One of the main things that people pointed out in the survey is that the spacing between projects was a bit off. The last two projects did not have any spacing between them, so I had to change the formatting of the comic from vertical to horizontal to give it more breathing room. Once I was able to identify what the actual issue was, the problem was pretty easy to fix. One other minor issue I faced was that my “about” page would get cut off on mobile view and I wasn’t sure of the problem. I realized that the image on the page was too large and did not fit into the grid so there was a small overflow issue. Once I sized down the actual image, the page was pretty much back to normal. Coding this site almost from scratch (except for using the starter code) was a really rewarding process and I am happy with the final result.
